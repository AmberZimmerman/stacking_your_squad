### Description of the project:
Stacking your squad is an application that allows you to easily add members of your team with different roles and different stats. User is prompted with a series of questions that allows them to choose the role of their teammate, then depending on that role, there will be always prompted with a series of questions that will ask for the name, id, and email of the team memeber. The user will also select the role of that person, which will have a series of specific questions based on that role. Once finished, a webpage will generate a user interface that displays the selected member roles and the answers to their questions. The email address will open in a new mail tab with the email address already populated. Also the github link will open to that users github.
